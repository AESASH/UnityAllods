# UnityAllods

The project has been forked from jewalky/UnityAllods

UPDATE: Project has migrated to Unity 2021.3.9f1

In order to test the code in Unity, open "unityallods.cfg" and add a line at the end of the file for the game to load the map. For example "map cross2.alm" this will enable unity to load the map.

The previous version by jewalky which is on Unity 2018 allows one to open the console from the game by pressing shift+~. However for the current version it is not working.
