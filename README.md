# UnityAllods

The project's goal is to implement an opensource port of an old russian RPG/RTS hybrid game called Rage of Mages II.
You will need the files from this archive in the root directory of the project:
http://www.mediafire.com/download/tcu49ocu359vaaa/AllodsRes.zip

Additionally, in the current state, the only way to run the game is opening the console (~ key)
and typing "map <filename>", where filename is any file in ROM2 format (.alm);

NOTE: Currently written with Unity 5.4.0 in mind, download here: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive (5.x -> 5.4.0)
